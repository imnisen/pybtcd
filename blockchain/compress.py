# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A variable length quantity (VLQ) is an encoding that uses an arbitrary number
# of binary octets to represent an arbitrarily large integer.  The scheme
# employs a most significant byte (MSB) base-128 encoding where the high bit in
# each byte indicates whether or not the byte is the final one.  In addition,
# to ensure there are no redundant encodings, an offset is subtracted every
# time a group of 7 bits is shifted out.  Therefore each integer can be
# represented in exactly one way, and each representation stands for exactly
# one integer.
#
# Another nice property of this encoding is that it provides a compact
# representation of values that are typically used to indicate sizes.  For
# example, the values 0 - 127 are represented with a single byte, 128 - 16511
# with two bytes, and 16512 - 2113663 with three bytes.
#
# While the encoding allows arbitrarily large integers, it is artificially
# limited in this code to an unsigned 64-bit integer for efficiency purposes.
#
# Example encodings:
#           0 -> [0x00]
#         127 -> [0x7f]                 * Max 1-byte value
#         128 -> [0x80 0x00]
#         129 -> [0x80 0x01]
#         255 -> [0x80 0x7f]
#         256 -> [0x81 0x00]
#       16511 -> [0xff 0x7f]            * Max 2-byte value
#       16512 -> [0x80 0x80 0x00]
#       32895 -> [0x80 0xff 0x7f]
#     2113663 -> [0xff 0xff 0x7f]       * Max 3-byte value
#   270549119 -> [0xff 0xff 0xff 0x7f]  * Max 4-byte value
#      2^64-1 -> [0x80 0xfe 0xfe 0xfe 0xfe 0xfe 0xfe 0xfe 0xfe 0x7f]

# - Pay-to-script-hash: (21 bytes) - <1><20-byte script hash>

# In order to reduce the size of stored amounts, a domain specific compression
# algorithm is used which relies on there typically being a lot of zeroes at
# end of the amounts.  The compression algorithm used here was obtained from
# Bitcoin Core, so all credits for the algorithm go to it.
#
# While this is simply exchanging one uint64 for another, the resulting value
# for typical amounts has a much smaller magnitude which results in fewer bytes
# when encoded as variable length quantity.  For example, consider the amount
# of 0.1 BTC which is 10000000 satoshi.  Encoding 10000000 as a VLQ would take
# 4 bytes while encoding the compressed value of 8 as a VLQ only takes 1 byte.
#
# Essentially the compression is achieved by splitting the value into an
# exponent in the range [0-9] and a digit in the range [1-9], when possible,
# and encoding them in a way that can be decoded.  More specifically, the
# encoding is as follows:
# - 0 is 0
# - Find the exponent, e, as the largest power of 10 that evenly divides the
#   value up to a maximum of 9
# - When e < 9, the final digit can't be 0 so store it as d and remove it by
#   dividing the value by 10 (call the result n).  The encoded value is thus:
#   1 + 10*(9*n + d-1) + e
# - When e==9, the only thing known is the amount is not 0.  The encoded value
#   is thus:
#   1 + 10*(n-1) + e   ==   10 + 10*(n-1)
#
# Example encodings:
# (The numbers in parenthesis are the number of bytes when serialized as a VLQ)
#            0 (1) -> 0        (1)           *  0.00000000 BTC
#         1000 (2) -> 4        (1)           *  0.00001000 BTC
#        10000 (2) -> 5        (1)           *  0.00010000 BTC
#     12345678 (4) -> 111111101(4)           *  0.12345678 BTC
