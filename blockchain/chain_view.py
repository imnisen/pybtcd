# BlockLocator is used to help locate a specific block.  The algorithm for
# building the block locator is to add the hashes in reverse order until
# the genesis block is reached.  In order to keep the list of locator hashes
# to a reasonable number of entries, first the most recent previous 12 block
# hashes are added, then the step is doubled each loop iteration to
# exponentially decrease the number of hashes as a function of the distance
# from the block being located.
#
# For example, assume a block chain with a side chain as depicted below:
# 	genesis -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 15 -> 16  -> 17  -> 18
# 	                              \-> 16a -> 17a
#
# The block locator for block 17a would be the hashes of blocks:
# [17a 16a 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 4 genesis]
class BlockLocator(list):

# chainView provides a flat view of a specific branch of the block chain from
# its tip back to the genesis block and provides various convenience functions
# for comparing chains.

#   genesis -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  -> 5 ->  6  -> 7  -> 8
#                         \-> 4a -> 5a -> 6a
#
# The chain view for the branch ending in 6a consists of:
#   genesis -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4a -> 5a -> 6a
