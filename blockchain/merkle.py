# BuildMerkleTreeStore creates a merkle tree from a slice of transactions,
# stores it using a linear array, and returns a slice of the backing array.  A
# linear array was chosen as opposed to an actual tree structure since it uses
# about half as much memory.  The following describes a merkle tree and how it
# is stored in a linear array.
#
# A merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is the hash of its
# children nodes.  A diagram depicting how this works for bitcoin transactions
# where h(x) is a double sha256 follows:
#
#             root = h1234 = h(h12 + h34)
#            /                           \
#      h12 = h(h1 + h2)            h34 = h(h3 + h4)
#       /            \              /            \
#    h1 = h(tx1)  h2 = h(tx2)    h3 = h(tx3)  h4 = h(tx4)
#
# The above stored as a linear array is as follows:
#
#     [h1 h2 h3 h4 h12 h34 root]
#
# As the above shows, the merkle root is always the last element in the array.
#
# The number of inputs is not always a power of two which results in a
# balanced tree structure as above.  In that case, parent nodes with no
# children are also zero and parent nodes with only a single left node
# are calculated by concatenating the left node with itself before hashing.
# Since this function uses nodes that are pointers to the hashes, empty nodes
# will be nil.
#
# The additional bool parameter indicates if we are generating the merkle tree
# using witness transaction id's rather than regular transaction id's. This
# also presents an additional case wherein the wtxid of the coinbase transaction
# is the zeroHash.
