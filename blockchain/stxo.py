# # spendJournalBucketName is the name of the db bucket used to house
# # transactions outputs that are spent in each block.
# spendJournalBucketName = b"spendjournal"


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The transaction spend journal consists of an entry for each block connected
# to the main chain which contains the transaction outputs the block spends
# serialized such that the order is the reverse of the order they were spent.
#
# This is required because reorganizing the chain necessarily entails
# disconnecting blocks to get back to the point of the fork which implies
# unspending all of the transaction outputs that each block previously spent.
# Since the utxo set, by definition, only contains unspent transaction outputs,
# the spent transaction outputs must be resurrected from somewhere.  There is
# more than one way this could be done, however this is the most straight
# forward method that does not require having a transaction index and unpruned
# blockchain.
#
# NOTE: This format is NOT self describing.  The additional details such as
# the number of entries (transaction inputs) are expected to come from the
# block itself and the utxo set (for legacy entries).  The rationale in doing
# this is to save space.  This is also the reason the spent outputs are
# serialized in the reverse order they are spent because later transactions are
# allowed to spend outputs from earlier ones in the same block.
#
# The reserved field below used to keep track of the version of the containing
# transaction when the height in the header code was non-zero, however the
# height is always non-zero now, but keeping the extra reserved field allows
# backwards compatibility.
#
# The serialized format is:
#
#   [<header code><reserved><compressed txout>],...
#
#   Field                Type     Size
#   header code          VLQ      variable
#   reserved             byte     1
#   compressed txout
#     compressed amount  VLQ      variable
#     compressed script  []byte   variable
#
# The serialized header code format is:
#   bit 0 - containing transaction is a coinbase
#   bits 1-x - height of the block that contains the spent txout
#
# Example 1:
# From block 170 in main blockchain.
